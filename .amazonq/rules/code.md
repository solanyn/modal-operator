# Software development

- **Readability**: Prioritise readability.
- **TDD**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
- **Changes**: Run formatter, linter and tests after each change
- **Comments**: Keep comments concise. Use comments to add context and describe behaviour.
- **Edit First**: Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless readability is compromised.
- **Keep context close**: Keep code that are used together close together
- **Respect existing codebase**: Match changes to style and patterns of existing code.
- **Collaborative**: Keep utility tools/scripts accessible. Develop with collaboration in mind.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Favor well-maintained dependencies or implement our own. Keep dependencies minimal.
- **Conventional Commits**: Enforce via git hooks for semantic versioning
- **Linting**: Go, YAML, Markdown, Shell, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript. Find standard tooling if not listed.
- **Examples**: Provide user-facing examples only. Avoid implementation-specific examples that expose internal architecture.
- **Planing**: Justify your implementation when planning
- **Review**: Review your own code as the last step in a plan
